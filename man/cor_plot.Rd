\arguments{
\item{data}{The dataframe from which the data will be sampled}

\item{x}{Independent variables, provided as a vector containing variable names as strings, e.g. c("iv1", "iv2", "iv3").}

\item{y}{Dependent variables, optional. Also provided as a vector. If no y values are specified, the function uses the x values for both
the x and y axis.}

\item{use}{Which values to use for the correlation. Can be any option for the `use` command of the `stats::cor` function, i.e. "everything", 
"all.obs", "complete.obs", "na.or.complete", or "pairwise.complete.obs". Defaults to "complete.obs".}

\item{method}{Which correlation method to use. Can be any option for the `method` command of the `stats::cor` function, i.e. "pearson"
"kendall", or "spearman". Defaults to "pearson".}

\item{digits}{How many digits should be shown in the plot. Defaults to 3.}

\item{digit_size}{How big the digits within each tile should be. Defaults to 4, but will probably need to be adjusted depending
on the number of variables}

\item{significance}{Whether significance of correlation should be computed. Significance will be included both in the table as well as
in the plot. Right now, computation of significance is done using the t-distribution, but not accounting for multiple comparisons.
Will be implemented in the future as an optional parameter.}

\item{sign_levels}{A list consisting of the significance levels as names and significance signs (e.g. "***") as values. Names must be provided
as strings and can have a leading zero (but don't have to), i.e. can be in form of e.g. ".001" or "0.001". Significance signs must
also be provided as strings. Defaults to .001 = three stars, .01 = two stars, .05 = one star}

\item{return_significant_only}{Whether the returned values (table, not the plot) should only contain the correlations that are significant. Defaults 
to FALSE. If set to TRUE, will return any correlation with a p value smaller than the largest supplied significance level. For example, if sign_levels is not modified,
any correlation with p < .1 will be returned. Only works if significance is set to TRUE.}

\item{CI}{Whether the CI for each correlation should be reported in the table. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{CI_conf_level}{Confidence level used for the CI. Defaults to 0.95.}

\item{plot_CI}{Whether the CI should be included below the correlation within the plot.}

\item{colorblind}{Whether the colors in the plot should be modified to a colorblind palette. Defaults to FALSE. Uses colors from the palette
colorblind_1 in this package if TRUE.}

\item{title}{Title that should be added to the plot. If not specified, title will be omitted.}

\item{label_rotation}{How many degrees the label on the x axis (corresponds to the values specified as 'y' if y != NULL) should be rotated.}

\item{return_plot}{Whether the plot should be returned. If TRUE, return value will be a list containing the table and the plot, the plot will not be printed. #
Can e.g. be used to pass the plot to plotly, which is helpful for large tables.}
}
\value{
Returns the correlation table and plots it as a heatmap. If return_plot is TRUE, also returns the ggplot object as a list element
together with the correlation table. Can be called using print(object$cor_plot)
}
\description{
Plots correlations between multiple variables as a heatmap. This function fulfills a similar need to psych::cor.plot()
but allows for different values on the x and y axis. It also simplifies a lot of stuff that is annoying about the function in the
psych package.
