\title{Plot correlations as a heatmap

Plots correlations between multiple variables as a heatmap.
This function fulfills a similar need to psych::cor.plot()
but allows for different values on the x and y axis. It also
simplifies a lot of stuff that is annoying about the function in the
psych package.}
\usage{
cor_plot(
  x,
  y = NULL,
  data,
  digits = 3,
  digit_size = 4,
  significance = T,
  sign_levels = list(`.001` = "***", `.01` = "**", `.05` = "*"),
  CI = T,
  conf_level = 0.95,
  plot_CI = T,
  colorblind = F,
  return_plot = F,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Independent variables, provided as a vector containing variable names as strings, e.g. c("iv1", "iv2", "iv3").}

\item{y}{Dependent variables, optional. Also provided as a vector. If no y values are specified, the function uses the x values for both
the x and y axis.}

\item{data}{The dataframe from which the data will be sampled}

\item{digits}{How many digits should be shown in the plot. Defaults to 3.}

\item{digit_size}{How big the digits within each tile should be. Defaults to 4, but will probably need to be adjusted depending
on the number of variables}

\item{significance}{Whether significance of correlation should be computed. Significance will be included both in the table as well as
in the plot. Right now, computation of significance is done using the t-distribution, but not accounting for multiple comparisons.
Will be implemented in the future as an optional parameter.}

\item{sign_levels}{A list consisting of the significance levels as names and significance signs (e.g. "***") as values. Names must be provided
as strings and can have a leading zero (but don't have to), i.e. can be in form of e.g. ".001" or "0.001". Significance signs must
also be provided as strings. Defaults to .001 = three stars, .01 = two stars, .05 = one star}

\item{CI}{Whether the CI for each correlation should be reported in the table. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{conf_level}{Confidence level used for the CI. Defaults to 0.95.}

\item{plot_CI}{Whether the CI should be included below the correlation within the plot.}

\item{colorblind}{Whether the colors in the plot should be modified to a colorblind palette. Defaults to FALSE. Uses colors from the palette
colorblind_1 in this package if TRUE.}

\item{return_plot:}{Whether plot should be returned as an object. If FALSE, plot will be printed
but not saved. If TRUE, function will return a list containing the correlation table and the ggplot data as elements.}
}
\value{
Returns the correlation table and plots it as a heatmap. If return_plot is TRUE, also returns the ggplot object as a list element
together with the correlation table. Can be called using print(object$cor_plot)
