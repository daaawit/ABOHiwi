#' @title Generate significance signs from p values
#'
#' Generate a vector of significance stars for a
#' set of p values.
#'
#' @param p_vals A vector of p values
#' @param sign_levels A list consisting of the significance levels as names and
#' significance signs as values. Names must be provided as strings and can have
#' a leading zero (but don't have to), i.e. can be in form of e.g. ".001" or "0.001".
#' Significance signs must also be provided as strings.
#' @return A vector of significance signs corresponding to the p values
