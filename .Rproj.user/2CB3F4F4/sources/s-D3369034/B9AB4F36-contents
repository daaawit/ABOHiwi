# Hypothesen

1. Social Presence Awareness decreases when the interaction process among team members is automated by a software agent, but increases again when the software agent fails. (curvilinear relationship)

2. Activity Awareness decreases when the interaction process among team members is automated by a software agent, but increases again when the software agent fails. (curvilinear relationship)

3. Social Presence Awareness and Activity Awareness are positively associated with Team Commitment and Willingness to do additional work

Exploratory Research Question:
Does the association between social presence and activity awareness and team commitment and motivation to work harder differ depending on the degree of the automation of team interaction processes?
